# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a given object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. The dataset used in this project contains 60 features (60 sonar measurements) and a binary target variable (R for rock, M for mine).

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Importing Dependencies**: We start by importing the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
2. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using the `pd.read_csv()` function.
3. **Exploring the Data**: We use the `sonar_data.head()` function to view the first few rows of the dataset and understand its structure.

## Feature Engineering and Selection
Since the dataset is already preprocessed, we don't need to perform any feature engineering. However, we can explore the data further to identify any potential relationships between the features and the target variable.

## Model Building and Evaluation
1. **Splitting the Data**: We split the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split()` function from `sklearn.model_selection`.
2. **Logistic Regression Model**: We use the `LogisticRegression()` class from `sklearn.linear_model` to build the machine learning model.
3. **Training the Model**: We fit the Logistic Regression model to the training data.
4. **Evaluating the Model**: We use the `accuracy_score()` function from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

## Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model was able to achieve an accuracy score of [insert accuracy score] on the testing data. This suggests that the model is capable of accurately predicting whether a given object is a rock or a mine based on the provided sonar data.

In the future, we could explore other machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines, to see if they can outperform the Logistic Regression model. Additionally, we could investigate feature importance to identify the most influential sonar measurements for the rock vs. mine prediction task.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python rock_vs_mine_prediction.py
   ```

The script will load the dataset, train the Logistic Regression model, and print the accuracy score on the testing data.
